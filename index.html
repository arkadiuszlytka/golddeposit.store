    <center><h2>REGION</h2></center>
  

 <p>Penhalonga is a small town, located in Manicaland in eastern
  Zimbabwe. Its hidden in the heart of the eastern highlands of
  Zimbabwe, where tradition meets modernity. Its spectacular sights
  and natural resources create the perfect background for a business
  activity. Penhalonga is located about 18 kilometers north of Mutare
  city, the main urban centre of the Manicaland region and one of the
  most important cities in eastern Zimbabwe. Mutare is an important
  commercial and cultural centre with developed infrastructure
  including schools, hospitals, shopping centres and transport services.
  The biggest advantage of Penhalonga is being located only a dozen or
  so kilometers west of Mozambique’s border and important
  communication routes leading to Beira — Mozambique’s main port on
  the Indian ocean. What’s more is that its located nearby A3 road,
  which connects Mutare with Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, and with a
  border crossing Forbes — Machipanda. Such location make sit a good
  place for international trade and cross border cooperation.</p>

  <center><h2>GOLD OF PENHALONGA - TREASURE HIDDEN UNDERNEATH</h2></center>
  

 <p>The gold deposits at Penhalonga are of extraordinary depth and richness. They
  are part of one of the most important gold-bearing belts in Zimbabwe,
  stretching across the entire eastern part of the country. Gold in this region
  comes in several forms - both as nuggets hidden in quartz veins and particles
  scattered in metamorphic rocks. They are distinguished not only by their
  abundance, but also by the quality of the ore. Gold ores in this region are rich in
  minerals, which makes them extremely attractive to investors and mining
  companies. Gold deposits in Penhalonga can be divided into alluvial deposits,
  which can be found closer to the surface and are located mainly in greenstone
  belts, and primary deposits, which occur in quartz veins that cut through the
  granite massifs of the region. These unique geological formations, part of the
  Zimbabwe Granite Shield, contain extremely high-quality gold.Some are
  several dozen meters wide and stretch for many kilometers, which makes the
  mining potential enormous. Such diverse forms allow the use of various
  mining methods, which increases the flexibility and operational possibilities of
  investors. These gold deposits are of extraordinary quality and abundance,
  making them one of the most sought after and valued in all of Africa. Gold
  mined in this region is famous for its exceptional purity and high market value.</p>

  <center><h2>HISTORY OF PENHALONGA FROM GOLD RUSH TO PRESENT DAY.</h2></center>
  

 <p>Penhalonga is a place with a rich history of gold mining. From the late th century unl taday, the
  region has attracted adventurers. investors and miners From all over the world. It was here that some of
  the mest important events of the Zimbabwe Geld Kush tock place, shaping the future of the regien and
  its communities. Penhalonga has a rich and fascinating history that dates back to the late th century,
  when the first geld depesits were discovered by ee settlers. In 1890, the Redwing mine was
  established here, which over time hecam me ene of the most Impertant gold mining centers in the country.
  The early years of the mine’s evelopment were Marked by difficult working conditions, but alse by great
  enthusiasm and hope for wealth, which attracted hundreds of prospectors from all over the world. Ac the
  beginning of the 20th century, thanks te investments and the influx of new technologies. the mine
  became a significant gold producer. Mining rook place both above and underground, allowing the
  exploitation of rich quartz veins that contained large amounts of high quality gold. During the interwar
  perind and after World War IL, Redwing was one of the leading gold producers in Zimbabwe. The mine
  attracted investors from all over the world, and the local community flourished thanks fo the growing
  demand for gold. However, in the 1970s and les, the mine began to suffer From problems related to the
  depletion of readily available resources, as well as the economic and political difficulties that were
  affecting Zimbabwe at the time. As a result, geld mining was partially limited and the mine faced
  challenges related ta medernization and restructuring. Currently, the Redwing Mine is experiencing a
  periand of rebirth as the region is onee again in the spodighe of investors interested in gold expleration
  and exploitation. Penhalonga’s gold deposits are still abundant and their porential has not been fully
  exploited. Thanks to medermn mining technelogics and improved infrastructure, it is possible te increase
  extraction and reeever resources that were previously considered unavailable.</p>

  <Center><h2>THE INVESTMENT POTENTIAL OF DEPOSITS</h2></Center>
  <p>Gold deposits at Penhalonga vary in both size and deposit type. It is estimated that the region has hundreds of tons of potential
    gold reserves waiting to be fully exploited. The size and diversity of gold deposits in Penhalonga create enormous investment
    opportunities. Many deposits in the region are still insulficiently explored, which provides an opportunity to discover new,
    previously unknown resources. It is estimated that only about 30-40% has been fully exploited so far, which means that the
    remaining 60-70% is still waiting to be explored and extracted.</p>

 <p>Red Wings mine, located in the heart of Penhalonga, is not only ene of the
  most Famous, but also historically most important gold mining sites in the
  region. For years, it was a symbol of the wealth and strategic importance of
  Zimbabwe's gold deposits. The mine's reserves are estimated to exceed 80
  tonnes of gold, with the potential for this Hgure to increase with Further
  gee ological. exploration and a better understanding of the deposit structure.
  Redwing has been at the forefront of domestic production since the 1990s,
  achieving impressive results of 5,000 20,000 ounces of gold per year.
  Although some of the sceposits have already been exploited, they still contain
  significant wealth. Modern mining technologies create opportunities ror
  even more elTective recovery of this valuable metal, which may transform
  Redwing into one of the most impertant places on the geld map net only in
  Zimbabwe, but also en the entire African continent. These deposits are
  distinguished by their extraordinary quality and purity, which makes them
  invariably desirable on global markets and cimphasize ses their strategic
  impertanee for the Future of mining in the region.</p>

 <p><b>DDTZ-OZGEO mine</b> is one of the most intriguing and dynamically
  developing gold mining sites in Zimbabwe. Co-created by a joint venture
  between the Development Trust of Zimbabwe (DTZ) and the Russian
  company OZGEO. This mine is an excellent example of international
  cooperation in the mining sector, where local knowledge combines with
  global expertise to create unique value in the raw materials market. The
  gold deposits in this mine are impressive in both quantity and quality. To
  date, DTZ-OZGEO has produced hundreds of thousands of ounces of gold,
  and their long-term development plan envisages even greater production
  in the coming years. Moreover, with further geological and exploration
  research, there is a high probability of discovering new deposits, which
  further increases the production potential oF this mine. Thanks to the use
  of modern mining technologies, this mine not only maximizes the
  elficiency of deposit exploitation, but alse minimizes the impact on the
  local natural environment. DTZ-OZGEO's activities are strictly controlled
  to ensure sustainable management of resources as well as maintaining
  high ecological standards.</p>

<div class="first-block">
<p><b>Muriel Gold Mine,</b> although perhaps less
  known compared to the giants of
  Zimbabwe's mining industry such as
  Redwing Mine, it holds a wealth of
  inestimable value. This gold mine is a
  perfect example of combining traditional
  mining methods with modern technologies.
  Gold deposits at the Muriel Gold Mine are
  estimated at several million ounces, with the
  prospect of significantly increasing
  production through further exploration and
  investment. This mine is characterized by
  rich gold veins with high concentration,
  which means that even at medium mining
  depth, gold production remains at a stable
  level. Annual production ranges from 10,000
  to 15,000 ounces, which proves its
  significant position in the local mining
  industry.</p>

  <center><h2>DEMAND FOR GOLD</h2></center>
  
 <p>• <b>China and India:</b> China and India remain leaders in
  gold consumption. In China, demand increased by 4% to
  900 tonnes, mainly driven by the jewelry sector and the
  growing middle class. India, despite economic
  challenges, increased its demand for gold by 5%, which
  translated into 600 tons. For both of these countries,
  gold is not only an investment, but also a symbol of
  security.<br>
  • <b>Russia:</b> In 2024, Russia continued its dedollarization
  strategy, increasing its gold reserves to 2,500 tons, a 7%
  increase compared to the previous year.
  <br>
  • <b>Brasil:</b> Brazil also increased its reserves to 140 tonnes,
  seeking stability in times of currency instability.</p>

  <center><h2>GOLD PRODUCTION</h2></center>
  

 <p>• <b>Russia and Brasil:</b> Russia maintained its position as one of the
  leading gold producers, with production of 330 tons. Brazil,
  although smaller, has managed to increase production to 110
  tonnes thanks to new investments and improved technology.
  <br>
  • <b>India: </b>Although India is not a large producer, in 2024 it began to
  take steps towards developing its own mining sector.
  <br>
  • <b>Increased production and recovery: </b>In 2024, gold
  production from mining increased by 4%, reaching an impressive
  893 tonnes. This means that mines around the world have
  increased their production to meet the growing demand for this
  valuable metal. Ilowever, it was not only mines that contributed to
  the increase in supply. Gold scrap that is recovered and processed
  has played a key role in meeting market needs. In the first quarter
  of 2024, 350.8 tons of gold scrap were recovered - 12% more than
  a year ago</p>

 <p>The average gold price in the first quarter of 2024
  Was USD 2,070 per ounce, an inerease of 10%
  compared to the previous year. The price reached a
  record high of $2.431/oz in April after the political
  crisis between Israel and Iran escalated. At the
  moment, it has already broken the price of USD
  2,500 per ounce. Gold maintained its high value also thanks te
  growing demand and strategic decisions made by
  the BRICS countries. BRICS countries have become
  key players in the gold market in 2024. The central
  banks of these countries are aggressively increasing
  their reserves to protect their economies from
  nancial sanctions and geopolitical instability. For
  these countries, gold becomes a key element of their
  reserve diversification strategy and pretection

  <center><h2>GOLD MARKET IN 2024 IN THE CONTEXT OF AMERICAN TREASURY BONDS</h2></center>
  <div class="gold-market-in-2024-block">
    <p>In 2024, gold is gaining importance in the eyes of global
    investors, especially in the Face of growing economic
    uncertainty. Traditionally considered a "safe haven,” U.S. 
    Treasuries are starting to lose their appeal. Reason? The
    increase in interest rates in the US and persistent inflation at
    3-4% encourage investors to look for alternatives. Interest rates
    are already reaching 5.5-6%, which is driving down the value of
    bonds and prompting many to turn to gold. In 2024, there will
    be a clear flow of capital from US treasury bonds to gold. Global
    gold backed ETFs attracted as much as $50 billion in the first
    half or the year, up 20% compared to the same period in 2025.
    Meanwhile, about $100 billion was withdrawn from US.
    Treasuries, reflecting investor concerns about future monetary
    policy and inflation. This trend shows that investors are
    increasingly turning to gold as a safer alternative in volatile
    times.</p>

  </div>
    <div class="gold-price-2-block">
    <p>• <b>Gold price:</b> In 2024, the gold price will fluctuate between USD 1,900 and USD 2,000 per ounce, which
      means an increase of 8% compared to 2023. This reflects increased demand for the precious metal,
      particularly as a protection against inflation and market volatility.
      <br>
      • <b>Yield on treasury bonds:</b> The US 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.5% from 3.2% in 2023. While
      theoretically higher interest rates may make bonds more attractive, their falling market value as interest
      rates rise discourages many investors, who are increasingly choosing gold as a safer haven.
      <br>
      • <b>De-dollarization:</b> This is onc of the most important trends affecting the gold market in 2024. This is the
      process of many countries gradually reducing their dollar reserves in favor of gold and other assets. China,
      which held $849 billion in US Treasuries as recently as 2023, reduced its reserves to $775 billion in April
      2024 - the lowest level since 2009. Similarly, other BRICS countries such as Brazil, India and Russia have
      also reduced their exposure to US Treasurics, investing in gold instead.
      <br>
      • <b>Common currency:</b> This is all part of a broader strategy to diversify forcign exchange reserves and
      become independent from the US dollar. In 2024, many BRICS countrics are considering the creation of a
      common currency based on gold, which could provide an alternative to the dollar in international trade
      transactions. Such a currency would aim to inereasc the financial sovercignty and economic stability of
      these countries.</p>

      <b>Central banks:</b> In 2024, central banks, especially in countries like
      Russia, China and Turkey, have focused on accumulating gold in
      response to rising inflation and political instability. Over the first three
      quarters, these three countries purchased a total of approximately 300
      tonnes of gold, contributing to an inerease in global central bank gold
      reserves to 39,500 tonnes—1.59 more than in 2025. Since 2022, central
      banks have purchased ever 2,000 tons of gold, which constitutes as
      much as 816 of all purchases of this metal by state insdtutions. This
      trend points toa shift away from the US dollar and a possible new role
      for gold in the global financial system. Gold prices are up mere than 15%
      in 2024, reaching the $2,100-$2,200 per ounce range, highlighting
      rising demand and tight supply. Central banks played a key role in this
      erowth, net purchasing 289.7 tonnes of gold in the first quarter—1%
      more than the same period last year and 1295 above the 2025 quarterly
      average. The largest buyers were the central banks of Turkey (30.1

     <p>
      The rise in gold prices in 2024 is also driven by rising
      geopolitical tensions. Confilcts in regions such as the Middle 
      East, East Asia and Eastern Europe are prompting investors
      to look for safe assets. Economic sanctions imposed on
      Russia and potential sanctions on China increase
      uncertainty in international markets, which in turn leads to
      greater interest in gold as a risk-hedging asset.
      <br><br>
      Iran, a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,
      is also increasing its gold reserves in preparation for
      potential sanctions and pressure from the West. This
      organization, the largest regional military organization in
      the world, brings together countries that together account
      for 75% of the world’s population and nearly half of global
      GDP, which further emphasizes the importance of gold as a
      protection from geopolitical uncertainty.</p>
